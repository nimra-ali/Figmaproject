              Every Moose is unique and algorithmically generated from more than
              200 possible traits! We specifically choose all 8 groups of
              traits: Background, Eyes, Mouth, Head, Fur, Clothes, Antlers, and
              Accessories.

              Some of them are rarer than the other, with 10 commanders being
              1/1 with unique traits that cannot be found in others.
